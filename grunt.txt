WHAT IS GRUNT?
Built on top of Node.js, Grunt is a task-based command-line tool that speeds up workflows by reducing the effort required to prepare assets for production. It does this by wrapping up jobs into tasks that are compiled automatically as you go along. Basically, you can use Grunt on most tasks that you consider to be grunt work and would normally have to manually configure and run yourself.
While earlier versions came bundled with plugins like JSHint and Uglyify, the most recent release (version 0.4) relies on plugins for everything.
What kind of tasks? Well, the list is exhaustive. Suffice it to say, Grunt can handle most things you throw at it, from minifying to concatenating JavaScript. It can also be used for a range of tasks unrelated to JavaScript, such as compiling CSS from LESS and Sass. Weâ€™ve even used it with blink(1) to notify us when a build fails.
